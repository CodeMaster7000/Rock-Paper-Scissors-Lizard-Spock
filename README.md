# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game coded by my friend (SmashedFrenzy16) and slightly edited by me. I found this an interesting take on the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game and wanted to share it with you. Run `python3 Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
